# CreekWise: An AI-Powered Trail Companion

**CreekWise** is an AI-enhanced web application designed to improve the trail experience at Coyote Creek Trail in Santa Clara County. The app was developed to address declining trail usage caused by safety concerns, habitat degradation, and limited ecological awareness. By providing real-time information, interactive maps, and educational tools, CreekWise empowers visitors to make safer, more informed visits while fostering environmental stewardship.

## üåü Key Features
- **Interactive Trail Maps:** Explore six unique maps of Coyote Creek Trail, each highlighting different trail sections and features.
- **Live Weather Integration:** Displays real-time weather conditions at the trailhead for informed trip planning.
- **Trail Popularity & Traffic Score:** AI-based metric showing how busy each trail segment is, factoring in time of day and weather conditions.
- **Real-Time Data Updates:** Automatically refreshes trail conditions and weather for current, actionable insights.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for accessible, mobile-friendly navigation and information display.

## üë©‚Äçüíª My Contributions
- Developed the **map section** with six different interactive trail maps
